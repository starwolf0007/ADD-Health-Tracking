# Bug Fix Decisions — NeuroFlow Phase 1

## BUG 1: Routine Duplication in UI

### Root Cause Analysis
The `watchActive()` method in `lib/data/routine_repository_impl.dart` uses `asyncMap()` to join Routines with their Steps. The problem manifests as routines appearing multiple times in the UI due to:

1. **Stream deduplication issue**: When the Routines table changes, `watchActiveRoutines()` emits a List<RoutineRow>. The `asyncMap` then fetches steps for each routine asynchronously. However, if there are rapid successive changes to the Routines or Steps tables, or if the provider is being watched multiple times, the same routine list can be emitted multiple times.

2. **No step-table watching**: The stream only watches the `Routines` table via `watchActiveRoutines()`. Changes to the `RoutineSteps` table don't trigger a new emission, which can cause stale data or duplicate emissions if the Routines table re-emits.

### Solution
Added manual deduplication logic to the stream using `.where()` to suppress consecutive equal emissions.

**File: `lib/data/routine_repository_impl.dart`**
- Added a `lastEmission` variable to track the previously emitted routine list
- Chained a `.where()` operator after `asyncMap()` to compare routine IDs
- Only emits when the routine list actually changes (ID-based comparison)
- This prevents duplicate emissions even if the source stream re-emits identical data

## BUG 2: Task Creation Constraint Error (Silent Failure)

### Root Cause Analysis
The `save()` method in `lib/data/task_repository_impl.dart` enqueues sync operations without proper error handling. The constraint error occurs due to:

1. **Silent error in SyncQueue insertion**: When creating multiple tasks, the second task's sync operation fails during `into(syncQueue).insert()` because:
   - The `insert()` method doesn't use conflict resolution
   - If there's any constraint violation (even if not visible in the schema), the operation fails
   - The error propagates but is never awaited in the UI layer, making it "silent"

2. **Missing conflict resolution**: The `enqueueSyncOp()` method uses `into(syncQueue).insert()` instead of `insertOnConflictUpdate()`. This doesn't handle duplicate insertions gracefully.

3. **Unhandled async error in UI**: The `_CaptureSheet._submit()` method doesn't await `addTask()`, so async errors are unhandled and logged but not shown to the user.

### Solution
Apply two fixes:

**File: `lib/platform/sync/sync_queue_repository_impl.dart`**
- Changed `insert()` to `insertOnConflictUpdate()` to handle potential constraint violations gracefully
- This allows duplicate operations to be replaced rather than causing a constraint error

**File: `lib/presentation/today_screen.dart`**
- Made the task submission async and await the `addTask()` call
- Added error handling to inform the user if task creation fails

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Minimal surgical fixes**: Only changed the specific methods causing the bugs, no refactoring
2. **Deduplication**: Using Dart's `distinct()` operator from stream operations
3. **Conflict resolution**: Using Drift's `insertOnConflictUpdate()` method for safe insertions
4. **Error visibility**: Adding async/await and error handling in the UI layer

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **BUG 1 Test**: Create a routine with 2+ steps, then rapidly complete steps and check that duplicates don't appear
2. **BUG 2 Test**: Create two tasks in quick succession and verify both are saved successfully
3. **Monitor**: Watch for any new errors in the sync queue after applying the fix

# Phase 2 STAGE 1: Global Privacy & Health Sync Toggle

## Design Decision: Privacy-First Default

### Rationale
The "Health data sync" toggle defaults to **OFF** for the following reasons:

1. **Privacy-first principle**: Users should never be synced to external health platforms without explicit consent. Health data is the most sensitive data the app handles.

2. **Regulatory alignment**: This default protects HIPAA compliance and similar privacy regulations by requiring affirmative opt-in before any health data leaves the device.

3. **Data minimization**: Users who don't need interoperability with Apple Health / Google Health see no sync attempts, reducing unnecessary external API calls and battery drain.

4. **Clear expectation setting**: Unlike Cloud Gemini (which users may assume is "normal" cloud behavior), health sync is opt-in only, making the user's privacy posture explicit and intentional.

### Where Sync Logic Hooks In (Phase 3)

The toggle gates **permissions only**. The actual sync implementation is deferred to Phase 3:

- **Current scope (Phase 2 STAGE 1)**: Toggle persists to FlutterSecureStorage via SettingsService. Provider wired for reactive state updates across the app. UI placed in "Privacy & Sync" settings section.

- **Phase 3 scope**: Actual data sync logic for Mood Logs will integrate with:
  - **iOS**: HealthKit API via platform channel (requires native Swift bridge)
  - **Android**: Google Fit API via platform channel (requires native Kotlin bridge)

The toggle will act as a guard in Phase 3 when these integrations are built, preventing any sync attempts if `globalPrivacyProvider.state == false`.

### Relationship with Cloud Gemini Toggle

Both toggles follow the same **privacy-critical, opt-in-only** pattern:

| Toggle | Default | Scope | Privacy Model |
|--------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Cloud Gemini | OFF | Task data → Google AI | Opt-in to cloud |
| Health Sync | OFF | Health logs → Apple/Google | Opt-in to external health platforms |

**Difference**: Cloud Gemini is "nice-to-have" (suggestion feature), while Health Sync is "must-have-permission" (interoperability). Both respect user autonomy.

### Files Modified

- `lib/platform/settings_service.dart` — added `getGlobalPrivacyEnabled()` and `setGlobalPrivacyEnabled()` methods
- `lib/presentation/settings_screen.dart` — added "Privacy & Sync" section with "Health data sync" toggle
- `lib/providers.dart` — added `globalPrivacyProvider` as StateProvider<bool>
- `DECISIONS.md` — this entry (documenting design rationale)

# Phase 2 STAGE 2: Living-State Tasks & Timeline Integration

## Design Decision: 7-State Task Lifecycle Model

### Why 7 States Instead of 3?

The original 3-state model (pending/completed/skipped) is binary — a task is either "done" or "not done". This doesn't capture the REAL workflow of someone with ADHD, where tasks are:

- **Started but not done** (in progress, paused, blocked, checkpointing)
- **Abandoned mid-execution** (paused for context switch)
- **Stuck waiting** (blocked on external input)
- **Partially complete** (checkpoint reached)

The 7-state model enables:

1. **Progress tracking without binary judgment** — "I did some work" is visible even if incomplete
2. **Re-entry recovery** — paused tasks surface in Phase 3 re-entry card, making it easier to resume
3. **Better prioritization** — blocked tasks sink; in-progress tasks surface; paused tasks available for momentum recovery
4. **Temporal awareness** — the Executive can see task state lifetime and make smarter plan decisions

### State Definitions

| State | Meaning | Transition | UI Implication |
|-------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **notStarted** | Task created but not touched | user clicks "start" | default state on creation |
| **preparing** | User thinking/planning before execution | user clicks "begin" | pre-execution mental load |
| **inProgress** | Task actively being worked on | user works; can pause/block/checkpoint | primary focus state |
| **paused** | Context switch, interruption, need to context switch | user resumes or moves on | recover via re-entry card (Phase 3) |
| **blocked** | Waiting for external input (reply, resource, decision) | external blocker resolved | sink in priority; may have metadata ("blocked by X") |
| **checkpoint** | Sub-phase complete (intermediate milestone) | user continues or pauses | celebrate progress without finishing |
| **complete** | Task fully finished | terminal state | gone from pending views, tracked in heartbeat |

**State diagram:**
```
notStarted → preparing → inProgress → {paused, blocked, checkpoint} → complete
                              ↓
                           (can jump to paused/blocked from any mid-execution state)
```

### Paused State — Critical for Phase 3

The **paused** state is specifically designed to enable the "re-entry card" feature in Phase 3 STAGE 3. When a user:

1. Starts a task (inProgress)
2. Realizes they need to context switch (hits pause button)
3. Returns to the app later

The app will surface "You were working on X — resume?" via a dedicated re-entry card, powered by searching for paused tasks in the timeline. This is a core ADHD UX pattern — removing friction to resume mid-task work.

### Executive.evaluate() Updates

The planner now:

1. **Distinguishes pending states**: `pending = {notStarted, preparing, inProgress, paused, blocked, checkpoint}`, `complete = {complete}`
2. **Deprioritizes paused tasks by default** — they appear after non-paused quick wins
3. **Surfaces paused tasks if user has momentum** — if other tasks are inProgress, paused tasks become quick-win candidates (Phase 3 momentum heuristic)
4. **Never shows paused as a terminal state** — it's always recoverable

### Timeline as Read-Only Projection

**Critical rule: NO NEW DATABASE TABLE** (§4, Timeline Rule).

The timeline is a **computed stream** that merges existing data:

- **Tasks**: Emit `taskCreated` event at `task.createdAt`, `taskCompleted` event at `task.completedAt` (if complete)
- **Routines**: Emit `routineStarted` at `routine.createdAt`, `routineCompleted` when all steps done (heuristic time in Phase 2; real timestamp in Phase 3)
- **Habits**: Emit `habitChecked` for each check-in, keyed to `checkIn.createdAt`

All merging happens in `timelineProvider` — a single StreamProvider that:
1. Watches taskRepositoryProvider.watchPending()
2. Watches activeRoutinesProvider
3. Watches activeHabitsProvider
4. Combines all three into a List<TimelineEvent>
5. Sorts by timestamp (most recent first)
6. Emits as a read-only stream

**Why no table?**
- Timeline events are derived (not primary data)
- Timestamps already exist in Task, Routine, Habit, and HabitCheckIn
- Computing in memory is cheaper than joins and reduces schema complexity
- If timeline data needs persistence later (archival, export), use the source events, never raw timeline rows

### Timestamp Derivation (Phase 2 Heuristics)

| Event Type | Timestamp Source |
|------------|-----------------|
| taskCreated | task.createdAt |
| taskCompleted | task.completedAt |
| routineStarted | routine.createdAt |
| routineCompleted | routine.createdAt + 1 hour (Phase 2 heuristic; Phase 3 captures real completedAt) |
| habitChecked | checkIn.createdAt |
| moodLogged | mood.createdAt (future feature; mood domain exists but not wired yet) |

### Files Modified

- `lib/domain/task.dart` — migrated TaskStatus to 7-state enum; added completedAt field; updated domain helpers
- `lib/domain/timeline_event.dart` — NEW; domain models for all timeline event types
- `lib/platform/local/database.dart` — updated openTasks(), watchOpenTasks(), untouchedFor(), and watchCompletedTodayCount() to use new TaskStatus states
- `lib/platform/local/task_repository_impl.dart` — updated complete() and archive() to use new states
- `lib/executive/planner.dart` — updated Executive.evaluate() to work with 7-state model; added paused task recovery heuristic
- `lib/providers.dart` — added timelineProvider (StreamProvider<List<TimelineEvent>>); added helper functions _taskStatusLabel() and _energyLabel()
- `DECISIONS.md` — this entry

### Phase 3 Notes — Future Work

#### Timeline View UI
Not implemented in Phase 2. Phase 3 STAGE 1 will create:
- TimelineScreen showing chronological activity feed
- Event cards (task, routine, habit, mood)
- Filtering by event type
- Date grouping (today, this week, older)

#### Re-Entry Card
Phase 3 STAGE 3 will use paused tasks from timeline to power:
- "You were working on X — resume?" card on Today screen
- Auto-suggests paused task if user revisits within 24 hours
- One-tap resume (returns task to inProgress)

#### Mood Log Integration
Mood domain exists (`lib/domain/mood.dart`) but MoodRepository is not wired. Phase 3 will:
- Create MoodRepository + Drift implementation
- Wire moodRepositoryProvider
- Emit MoodEvent from timeline when moods logged
- Timeline view shows mood events (color-coded)

#### Captured Timestamp for Routines
Phase 2 uses heuristic (createdAt + 1 hour) for routine completion. Phase 3 will:
- Add completedAt field to Routine domain
- Capture actual time when last step completed
- Update database schema (Routines table)
- Update timeline to use real timestamp

### Backward Compatibility

Existing tasks with status=pending migrate to status=notStarted automatically (Drift migration in Phase 3). The `isPending` computed property works with the new model:

```dart
bool get isPending => status != TaskStatus.complete;
```

This means old code filtering for `isPending` continues to work with new states.

# Phase 2 STAGE 3: Re-Entry Card

## Design Decision: Progress-First Re-Entry UI for Paused Tasks

### Purpose

The Re-Entry Card is an ADHD-friendly feature that surfaces paused tasks with minimal friction. When a user returns to the app after context-switching, a single card offers:

1. **Progress celebration** — show the work already done ("60% progress")
2. **Context recall** — remind them where they paused ("Paused at: Step 4")
3. **Micro-action suggestion** — one small next step ("Next: Check logs")

This follows ADHD-friendly UX patterns:
- **Progress-first messaging**: Show wins before asking for more effort
- **Context preservation**: Exact checkpoint reduces re-orientation time
- **Minimal friction**: One tap to resume; one tap to dismiss

### Architecture: No Database Changes

The Re-Entry Card uses **existing Task fields only**:
- `status = TaskStatus.paused` (already defined in Phase 2 STAGE 2)
- `notes` (existing field — parsed heuristically in Phase 2)
- `title` (used to infer next action)
- `createdAt` (used to sort paused tasks by recency)

**No new tables, no new columns.** Phase 3 will add persistent step tracking if needed; Phase 2 uses best-effort heuristics.

### Phase 2 Heuristics

The `ReentryAdvisor` class analyzes a paused task using simple pattern matching:

1. **Progress percentage**: Count newline-delimited lines in task.notes
   - 1 line → 25%
   - 2-3 lines → 50%
   - 4-5 lines → 60%
   - 6+ lines → 75% (capped below 100% until task marked complete)

2. **Paused-at step**: Extract the last line of task.notes
   - Strips leading numbers/bullets ("1. Step" → "Step")
   - Wrapped in quotes: `Paused at: "Step 4: Deploy"`

3. **Suggested action**: Pattern match on task title verbs
   - "Deploy X" → "Check logs"
   - "Review PR" → "Merge if approved"
   - "Write email" → "Send reply"
   - "Setup X" → "Test it"
   - Default: "Continue"

**Phase 2 limitation**: These are estimates. A user might have completed 2 of 5 steps, but if they only wrote 2 notes lines, progress shows ~50% instead of 40%. The heuristic favors showing progress.

### Phase 3 Future: Real Step Tracking

Phase 3 STAGE 3 will:

1. Add `SubtaskCompletion` table in database (tracks which subtasks are done)
2. Compute real progress: `(completed / total) * 100`
3. Replace title/notes parsing with actual step metadata
4. Enable richer context: "Step 4 of 8 done" instead of "60% progress"

### UI: Re-Entry Card Placement

The card appears in the Today screen's normal mode, **above the primary task**:

```
[Header: Hey, User | Count: 7]
─────────────────────────────────
[Re-Entry Card — paused task]
─────────────────────────────────
[Primary Task Card]
─────────────────────────────────
[Due Routines / Habits]
```

**Visibility logic**:
- Show only if `pausedTasks` list is non-empty
- Show only the **top 1 paused task** (most recent)
- Use `snoozeForSession()` for dismiss (visual only; no DB change)
- Use `resumePausedTask()` for resume (transitions paused → inProgress)

### Components

**File: `lib/executive/reentry_advisor.dart`**
- `ReentryAdvisor` class — analyzes paused tasks
- `ReentryData` class — holds progress %, paused-at step, suggested action
- Private helpers: `_extractSteps()`, `_estimateProgress()`, `_extractPausedAtStep()`, `_suggestAction()`

**File: `lib/presentation/widgets/reentry_card.dart`**
- `ReentryCard` StatelessWidget — renders the UI
- Layout: header (pause icon + title) → progress bar → context → action → buttons
- Colors: AppColors.accent border, AppColors.surface fill (matches other cards)
- Buttons: "← Go back" (dismiss) | "Resume →" (resume)

**File: `lib/providers.dart`**
- `pausedTasksProvider` — FutureProvider that filters pending tasks for status=paused
- `TodayController.resumePausedTask()` — transitions paused → inProgress and recomputes plan

**File: `lib/presentation/today_screen.dart`**
- Updated `_NormalBody` to watch `pausedTasksProvider` and show card if available
- Wired resume/dismiss buttons to controller methods

### Dismissal Behavior

The "← Go back" button calls `snoozeForSession()`, which:
- Adds task ID to `_snoozedIds` set in TodayController
- Invalidates the provider to trigger rebuild
- **Does not** modify database — dismissal is session-local only
- Card reappears if user restarts the app (re-entry still available)

**Rationale**: Users may want to dismiss the card without actually resuming, but we should re-prompt on next session if the task remains paused. Session-only snooze gives immediate UI relief without losing the re-entry opportunity.

### Files Modified

- `lib/executive/reentry_advisor.dart` — NEW; advisory logic for paused tasks
- `lib/presentation/widgets/reentry_card.dart` — NEW; UI component
- `lib/presentation/today_screen.dart` — added ReentryCard widget, imported it, updated _NormalBody to ConsumerWidget
- `lib/providers.dart` — added `pausedTasksProvider`, added `resumePausedTask()` method to TodayController
- `DECISIONS.md` — this entry

### Testing Notes

1. **Create a paused task**: Create a task, mark it inProgress, then manually change status to paused (via DB query in test)
2. **Verify progress estimation**: Add notes with 3-5 lines, verify progress shows ~50-60%
3. **Verify action suggestion**: Create a task titled "Deploy database", verify suggested action is "Check logs"
4. **Test resume flow**: Tap "Resume →", verify task transitions to inProgress and re-entry card disappears
5. **Test dismiss flow**: Tap "← Go back", verify card hides (but stays in DB as paused, re-appears on app restart)
